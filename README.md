# Corporate Sustainability

This repository contains our project, "Towards Sustainability or Greenwashing â€“ Analyzing Companies Sustainability Reporting." Our goal is to determine whether companies are genuinely implementing sustainable practices or merely greenwashing their activities. We achieve this by creating text classification algorithms to detect environmental claims in companies' sustainability reports, developing an "environmental claims" score, and comparing this score to their actual environmental performance.

## Data
 1. The data used to train our model is made by [ClimateBert](https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatebert/environmental_claims/tree/main).
 2. The data used to validate the selected companies claims is fetched from [TRUCOST](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/trucost).

## Project Structure

1. Identify UN sustainability goals addressed by this project
2. Conduct literature search on recent research and commercial solutions in this area
3. Decide on the problem-solving approach 
4. Collect, clean, and annotate data
5. Download the "environmental claims" dataset and explore it
6. Implement and compare text classification algorithms
7. Compute the "environmental claims" score for selected company sustainability reports
8. Compare the "environmental claims" score to the companies' actual environmental performance
9. Create a simple interface for returning environmental claims score and performance metrics
10. Quantify the solution and compare it to baselines
11. Deliverables: Github page, report, code, experiments, video, and LinkedIn article (optional)

## Usage

The main findings of our project is found in the notebook [Corporate Sustainability](https://github.com/percw/Corporate_sustainability/blob/main/Companies_sustainability.ipynb).
