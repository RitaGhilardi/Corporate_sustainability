       "' \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n1  \\n \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n2 Annual report 2020 \\n \\nGjensidige Pensjonsforsikring AS (GPF) is a wholly owned \\nsubsidiary of Gjensidige Forsikring ASA and is headquartered in \\nOslo. Its activities are aimed at the life-  and pension business \\nand the company offer products both to private and commercial \\ncustomer s. The company was established in 2005 and focuses \\non sales of defined contribution plans and risk coverage for both customer groups.  \\nThe company delivers products in the following main categories:  \\n• Occupational pension -  Defined contribution plans with \\nassociated risk coverage  \\n• Management of paid- up certificates and paid- up policies  \\n• Individual pension savings (unit linked)  \\n• Individual disability pension \\n \\nThe company offers only externally managed funds  for unit \\nlinked products.  \\nDistribution of the company\\'s occupational products takes place \\nprimarily through the parent company Gjensidige Forsikring \\nASA, in addition to other external distributors. Private pension \\nproducts are distributed online and through a separate sales \\nforce.  \\nCovid-19 \\nThe Covid- 19 pandemic has had a limited effect on the \\ncompany\\'s results. As the share prices fell in the first quarter, the \\ncompany experienced a negative financial return and \\nsubsequently lower management income during the summer. The situation improved over the fal l and the current level of \\nassets under management and associated revenues are well above what they were before the pandemic. The company\\'s other revenues are only to a small extent affected by the \\npandemic short term but is exposed to increased disability  long \\nterm as a result of redundancies and bankruptcies and general \\nreductions in number of customers. Due to a comprehensive \\nassessment process, it normally takes one to two years before \\nany increase in disability claims becomes visible. In order to be \\nwell prepared, GPF has since March this year capitalized all risk \\npremiums related to the disability products.  \\nThe pandemic has pushed interest rates down which made it \\nmore demanding to meet guarantees, and low interest rates are also negative for the solve ncy margin. In order to strengthen the \\nlatter, reinsurance was taken out to mitigate lapse risk, which was important for maintaining the solvency margin at a satisfactory level. GPF has also managed to meet virtually all \\ninterest rate guarantee obligations  and the use of additional \\nprovisions has been minor.  \\nThis year’s performance \\nGPF achieved a good result in 2020. The year was \\ncharacterized by steady and good operations with growth in the \\ncustomer portfolios and capital, that explains increased \\nadministr ation and management revenues. Last year, a positive \\nrisk result was realized related to the paid- up policies as a \\nconsequence of an increase in reactivations of previously reported disabled people. Such a development has not been repeated this year which explains the reduced insurance \\nrevenues. Good financial returns meant that the company\\'s financial income remained at a satisfactory level.  \\nSales has also been good with a good influx of new members. However, the company\\'s largest customer left at the beginning of \\n2020. Hence the total number of members for group defined \\ncontribution pensions is slightly below the entry value at the \\nbeginning of the year. The amount of new PKBs has been very good and the number of members has increased by approx. 9 \\nper cent.  \\nGPF’s market share relating to occupational defined contribution \\nplans amounted per the third quarter to 9.2 per cent and to 6.9 \\nper cent relating to individual pensions. The market share \\nrelating to transferred private pension funds amounted to 8,3 per \\ncent and to 8.6 per cent relating to occupational pension funds. \\nThe market share relating to private disability pension was 22.0 per cent. (Source: Finans Norge, third quarter 2020).  \\nIncome \\nGross written premiums amounted to NOK 5,748.6 million in \\n2020. Of this NOK 3.913,4 million were written premiums and \\nNOK 1,835.2 million were transferred funds. By comparison, in 2019 gross written premiu ms were NOK 5,623.0 million of which \\nNOK 3,938.9 million were written premiums and NOK 1,684.1 \\nmillion were transferred funds. Premiums written increased due \\nto growth in the customer portfolio, both relating to occupational \\npensions and individual disabil ity pensions.  \\nThe paid- up policy portfolio contributed with a net financial \\nincome of NOK 16,0 million above the guaranteed return. GPF \\nfollows a conservative investment strategy. The life companies \\nare required to strengthen premium reserves by 2021 so that \\nthey can meet expected increasing future liabilities as a result of a generally increasing life expectancy. GPF started early with \\nthe reservation which was completed in 2018 after NOK 196.5 \\nmillion was added to the reserves. Total additional provisions  \\nrelated to the paid- up policy portfolio where NOK 295.8 million at \\nthe end of the year, compared with NOK 284.0 million in 2019.  \\nThe other group portfolio contributed with a financial income of \\n87.9 NOK million. Of this NOK 57.9 million was allocated to the \\ncustomers, of which NOK 55.0 million was guaranteed return. \\nGPF\\'s share of returns related to the other group portfolio totaled \\nNOK 29 .9 million.  \\nOther financial income was NOK 6 .2 million and represents the \\nreturn on the company’s own funds.  \\nClaims, i ncluding transfers to other companies, amounted to \\nNOK 3,479.3 million in 2020 and NOK 2,760.0 million in 2019.  \\nTotal operating costs amounted to NOK 291.1 million in 2020 \\ninclusive charges billed for corporate services. Total operating costs in 2019 were NOK 275.6 million. The growth is due to \\nincreased business volume, increased headcount and an impairment on IT -systems. The costs are as expected.  \\nFor the fiscal year of 2020 total earnings were NOK 124.1 \\nmillion, compared to NOK 147.7 million in 2019. T he board \\nconfirms that the accounts have been submitted on the \\nassumption of continued operations. \\nIndividual Pension Account  \\nOn 9 April 2019, the Norwegian Parliament resolved on changes in the defined contribution law (individual pension account).  \\nAccor ding to the new rules, individual pension certificates will be \\ntransferred to, and managed by, either the employer’s pension \\nmanager or a supplier decided by the employee’s himself. The \\nchanges also apply to the so called 12 -month rule which no \\nlonger appl ies, hence employees with defined contribution plans \\nare viable for earned pension irrelevant of tenure.  \\nThe purpose of individual pension account is to reduce the \\nexpenses for management of pension funds in addition to \\nimproving employees’ insight in ear ned pension. The new rules \\nare to come in force on 1 January 2021.   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n3 It is uncertain how individual pension account will affect the \\nmarket. The product opens for new providers not being traditional life companies, and competition will be intensified in \\nan already tough market. GPF has worked intensively in order to \\nbe prepared to handle both the market and the product. Significant work has been accomplished to establish good \\ncustomized solutions that will make the company an attractive \\nsupplier. Individual p ension account creates new opportunities \\nand GPF will actively seek to take a position in this new market.  \\nReturn  \\nGPF offers three main alternatives for managing defined \\ncontribution schemes, active, combined or index management. \\nAll options offer to choos e between different risk profiles: \\n“Trygg”, “Balansert”, “Offensive” and “Age- adjusted”.  \\nThe year 2020 was a turbulent year in financial markets due to \\nCOVID -19 and the measures taken worldwide trying to prevent \\nthe pandemic from spreading. During the wors t days in March \\nthe MSCI World Index fell 32 per cent, measured in USD. Stimuli \\nfrom fiscal and monetary packages, as well as positive vaccine \\nnews, helped turn the markets, and MSCI World ended positive \\n15.9 per cent for 2020. The US S&P 500 Index rose 18,4 per \\ncent, emerging economies (MSCI EM) rose 15.8 per cent, while \\nEurope MSCI Europe (Price) ended down - 4.3 per cent.  Norway \\nalso had a relatively weaker development, and the Oslo Stock \\nExchange OSEBX ended up 4.6 per cent while the OSEFX fund \\nindex rose 7.3 per cent. \\nFor the first time in history, the Norwegian Central Bank cut the \\nkey interest rate to 0 per cent in 2020. The US Federal Reserve also lowered the rate in the range of 0 -0.25 per cent, and the \\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) has kept the rate unchanged at -\\n0.50 per cent. The outlook from the central banks is that interest rates will be kept low for a long time to come.  \\nThe active equity profile had a return of 13.4 per cent and the \\ncombined equity profile had a return of 8.9 per cent. The fixed \\nincome combined profile had a return of 7.6 per cent.  \\nThe booked return on the paid -up policy portfolios was 3.5 per \\ncent, while the value -adjusted return was 3.0 per cent. The \\naverage interest rate guarantee for the paid- up policy portfolio \\nwas 3.4 per cent. For the other group portfolio, the booked return \\nwas 3.2 per cent and the value -adjusted return 3.2 per cent.  \\nBalance Sheet  \\nAssets under management increased by NOK 5,026.5 million during 2020 amounting to NOK 42,361.7 million by year -end. At \\nthe end  of the year GPF had a total balance of NOK 43,945.8 \\nmillion, of this equity amounted to 2.3 per cent.  \\nSolvency \\nAt the end of 2020 the reported solvency margin was 146.2 per cent. The reported solvency margin is at a satisfactory level and \\nthere is no need to take further actions.  \\nOrganisation \\nAt the end of 2020 the company had 85 full time employees who are all located at the Oslo headquarter. Most of the employees \\nare engaged in contract and customer management. In addition, there are separate departm ents for product development and \\ntechnical IT support/development.  \\nSales of occupational pension schemes are done through the parent company Gjensidige Forsikring ASA which employs 15 pension advisors who are spread throughout the country with \\nOslo, Kristi ansand, Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and Tromsø \\nas geographical centers. Sales are aimed primarily at the \\ntransfer market for defined contribution plans. In addition, it is \\nestablished a sales center in Oslo for telemarketing to \\nGjensidige Forsikring\\'s com mercial customers. At the end of the \\nyear 8 employees were working at the center. GPF also employs 5 investment advisors for sale of private pension products. These are all located in the Oslo area.  \\nOperational risk \\nThe company continuously assesses its own risk situation in \\naccordance with approved procedures for internal control. As part of the annual planning and budgeting process a risk \\nassessment is drawn up where the main short-  and long- term \\nrisks are described together with necessary measures. The \\nassessment is adopted by the board and followed up regularly \\nthroughout the year.  \\nFinancial risk \\nFinancial risk is a collective term for several types of risks \\nassociated with financial assets. Financial risk can be divided \\ninto market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks arise from GPF\\'s investment activities. They are managed aggregated \\nand handled through the company’s asset management \\nstrategy.  \\nGPF is exposed to financial risk through a small trading stock. This is a technical  holding arising because of the internal \\nprocessing time for buying and selling funds on behalf of clients.  \\nThe group portfolio consists of two portfolios:  \\n• Paid- up policy portfolio  \\n• Other group portfolio \\n \\nThe paid- up policy portfolio and part of the other  group portfolio \\ninclude a guaranteed interest liability which represents a \\nfinancial risk. Average guaranteed return for the paid -up policies \\nwas 3.4 per cent per 31.12.2020. For the other group portfolio, the guaranteed return varied between 2.0 and 2.7 per cent. The \\nmain risk elements related to the group portfolio are share \\nprices, interest rates and credit. Risk - and asset management is \\nundertaken in accordance with applicable regulations through a \\nmanagement agreement with the parent company Gjensidige Forsikring ASA.  \\nCompany assets are held in the form of bank deposits in \\nNorwegian kroner and investments in fixed income – short \\nduration  and bonds at amortised cost.  \\nThe risk of losses on receivables is minor.  \\nInsurance risk \\nGPF offers insurance products in the form of pensions, mainly \\ngroup and individual disability pension.  According to the \\nregulations the company also needs to offer premium waivers \\nrelated to occupational disability, included in the defined \\ncontribution schemes. There is also a limit ed portfolio of survivor \\npensions (spouse\\'s pension / child pension).  \\nThe insurance risk situation is considered to be satisfactory and \\nthe uncertainty related to not reported cases are handled \\nthrough the claim reserves.  \\nThe company has a reinsurance agreement both with the parent \\ncompany Gjensidige Forsikring ASA and external vendors, which provides satisfactory coverage for handling major \\nvariations in occurred claims.  \\nWork environment  \\nThe working environment is good which is confirmed by employee satis faction surveys. There have not been any injuries \\nor accidents at the workplace in 2020. Sick leave amounted to \\n3.4 per cent.  \\n   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n4 Equality \\nAs a fully owned subsidiary, GPF is included in Gjensidige\\'s \\nwork and routines for gender equality and the company is a  part \\nof the group\\'s annual reporting.  \\nAt GP F, we work to make sure that we have an inclusive culture \\nwhere everyone is treated equally and with respect. We must acknowledge our employees’ knowledge, competencies and \\nstrengths, regardless of gender, pregnancy, leave of absence for childbirth or adoption, care responsibilities, ethnicity, religion, \\nbeliefs, functional impairment, sexual orientation, gender identity \\nand gender expression, and combinations of the above.  \\nAt GPF, all employees are normally hired in full- time positions. \\nAn exception can be made if an employee applies for a \\ntemporary or a permanent reduction in working hours for social, \\nhealth -related or other weighty welfare reasons. Some of our \\nemployees work less than 100 per cent of a full -time position, \\nbut they are positions of a temporary nature, such as student \\ninternships. On this basis, we believe we can say for certain that \\nnone of our employees work part -time involuntarily.  \\nEmphasis is placed on having a most equal distribution between \\ngenders at all levels, and under the same circumstances \\nunderrepresented gender will be given priority when vacant \\npositions are announced.

Accounting policies  \\nReporting entity \\nGjensidige Pensjonsforsikring  AS (GPF) is a company domiciled \\nin Norway. The company’s head office is located at \\nSchweigaardsgate 12, Oslo, Norway. The activities of the \\ncompany are life and pension insurance. The company does business in Norway.  \\nThe accounting policies applied in the financial statements are \\ndescribed below.  \\nBasis of preparation \\nStatement of compliance \\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with \\nthe Norwegian Accounting Act and Norwegian Financial \\nReporting Regulations for Insurance Companies (FOR 2015 -12-\\n12-1824 ). The Norwegian Financial Reporting Regulations for \\nInsurance Companies is to a great extent based on IFRSs endorsed by EU, and interpretations. \\nNew standards adopted  \\nGPF has not implemented any new standards with effect from 1 \\nJanuary 2020.  \\nNew standards and interpretations not yet adopted  \\nA number of new standards, changes to standards and \\ninterpretations have been issued for financial years beginning \\nafter 1 January 2020 . They have not been applied when \\npreparing these financial statement s. Those that may be \\nrelevant to GPF are mentioned below. GPF does not plan early \\nimplementation of these standards.  \\nIFRS 9 Financial instruments (2014)  \\nIFRS 9 addresses the accounting for financial instruments and is \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January \\n2018. The standard introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a \\nnew expected loss model for the recognition of impairment \\nlosses, and changed requirements for hedge accounting.  \\nIFRS 9 contains three primary measurement categories for \\nfinancial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income, and fair value through profit or loss. \\nFinancial assets will be classified as either at amortised cost, at \\nfair value through other comprehensive income, or at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss, depending on how they are managed and \\nwhich contractual cash flow properties they have. IFRS 9 introduces a new requirement in connection with financial \\nliabilities earmarked at fair value, where changes in fair value \\nthat can be attributed to the liabilities\\' credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income rather than over profit or loss.  \\nImpairment provisions according to IFRS 9 shall be measured \\nusing an expected loss m odel, instead of an incurred loss model \\nas in IAS 39. The impairment rules in IFRS 9 will be applicable \\nto all financial assets measured at amortised cost and interest \\nrate instruments at fair value through other comprehensive \\nincome. In addition, loan com mitments, financial guarantee \\ncontracts and lease receivables are within the scope of the \\nstandard. The measurement of the provision for expected credit \\nlosses on financial assets depends on whether the credit risk \\nhas increased significantly since initial  recognition. At initial \\nrecognition and if the credit risk has not increased significantly, the provision shall equal 12- month expected credit losses. If the \\ncredit risk has increased significantly, the provision shall equal \\nlifetime expected credit losses. This dual approach replaces \\ntoday’s collective impairment model.  Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments \\nwith IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (2016)  \\nThe amendments to IFRS 4 permit entities that predominantly \\nundertake insurance activities the option to defer the effective date of IFRS 9 until 1 January 2023. The effect of such a \\ndeferral is that the entities concerned may continue to report \\nunder the existing standard, IAS 39 Financial Instruments.  \\nGPF is an insurance company and has ther efore decided to \\nmake use of this exception  \\n \\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (2017)  \\nIFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts, published on May 18, 2017 with \\neffect from 1 January 2023 . IFRS 17 establishes the principles \\nfor the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance \\ncontracts. The new standard applies to insurance contracts \\nissued, to all reinsurance contracts and to investment contracts \\nwith discretionary participating features provided the entity also \\nissues insurance contracts. The standard defines the level of \\naggregation to be used for measuring the insurance contract \\nliabilities and the related profitability. IF RS 17 requires identifying \\nportfolios of insurance contracts, which comprise contracts that \\nare subject to similar risks and are managed together. Each portfolio of insurance contracts issued shall be divided into three \\ngroups:  \\n• contracts that are onerous at initial recognition  \\n• contracts that at initial recognition have no significant \\npossibility of becoming onerous subsequently  \\n• and the remaining contracts in the portfolio  \\nContracts that are issued more than one year apart should not be in the same group.  \\nIFRS 17 requires a general measurement model based on the \\nfollowing “building blocks”:  \\n• probability -weighted estimates of future cash flows, \\nan adjustment to reflect the time value of money and \\nthe financial risks associated with those future cash \\nflows, and a risk adjustment for non- financial risk  \\n• the Contractual Service Margin (CSM)  \\nAt the end of each subsequent reporting period the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts is remeasured to be \\nthe sum of:  \\n• the liability for remaining coverage, which comprices \\nthe fulfilment cash flows related to future services and \\nthe CSM at that date  \\n• and the liability for incurred claims, which is measured \\nas the fulfilment cash flows related to past services at \\nthat date  \\nA simplified Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) is permitted for \\nthe measurement of the liability for the remaining coverage if it \\nprovides a measurement that is not materially different from the \\ngeneral model or if the coverage period is one year or less. With \\nthe PAA, the liability for remaining coverage corresponds to premiums received at initial recognition less acquisition costs. \\nHowever, the general model remains applicable for the \\nmeasurement of incurred claims.  \\nInsurance revenue, insurance service expenses and insurance finance income of expenses will be presented separately in the \\nincome statement. The standard will have an effect on the  \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n12 group’s financial statements, significantly changing the \\nmeasurement and presentation of income and expenses. Calculations are carried out to determine t he effects this will \\nhave on the financial statements.  \\nIASB has decided to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to the reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2023.  \\nBasis of measurement  \\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared \\nbased on the historical cost principle with the following \\nexceptions  \\n• financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss \\nare measured at fair value \\n \\nPresentation currency \\nThe financial statements are presented in NOK which are the functional currency in GPF. All financial information is presented \\nin NOK, unless otherwise stated.  \\nDue to rounding differences, figures and percentages may not \\nadd up to the total. \\nAssociated co mpanies  \\nAssociated companies are companies where GPF has \\nsignificant influence, but not control over the financial and \\noperational management.  \\nAssociated companies are accounted for using the equity \\nmethod. Dividends reduce the carrying amount of the \\ninves tment. Investor\\'s share of excess value is recognized on a \\nseparate line in the income statement.  \\nCash flow statement  \\nCash flows from operating activities are presented according to \\nthe direct method, which gives information about material \\nclasses and paym ents.  \\nRecognition of revenue and expenses \\nPremiums  \\nGross premiums are recognized as income by the amounts due \\nduring the year. Premiums are normally collected in monthly installments, and accruals are not necessary. Policies that do \\nnot have monthly installments are initially accrued and \\nsubsequently added to the premium reserve. \\nTransfer of premium reserves  \\nPremium reserves transferred from other companies are \\nrecognized in the income statement from the date the company \\nhas assumed the risks. Transferred additional statutory reserves \\nare not considered as premiums but reported as changes in \\nreserves for the group policy portfolio.  \\nClaims  \\nClaims show the annual claims paid in the form of pensions and \\nare recognized at the time that payments incurred.  \\nReins urance  \\nCeded reinsurance premiums reduce gross premiums written and are adjusted for according to the insurance period. Paid claims are reduced by reinsurance share.  \\nNet income from investments  \\nFinancial income consists of interest income on financial investments, dividend received, realised gains related to \\nfinancial assets, change in fair value of financial assets at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss, and gains on financial derivatives. \\nInterest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective \\ninterest method.  \\nFinancial expenses consist of interest expenses on loans, \\nrealised losses related to financial assets, change in fair value of \\nfinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss, recognised \\nimpairment on financial assets and recognised loss on financial  derivatives. All expenses related to loans are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.  \\nPolicyholders’ profit  \\nGuaranteed return on premium reserves and pensioners\\' surplus fund is recognized under the item changes in reserves for the \\ngroup policy portfolio.\\n \\nInsurance -related operating expenses \\nInsurance related operating expenses consist of administration- , \\nsales - and management expenses. \\nForeign currency transactions  \\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the \\nrespective functional currencies at exchange rates at the date of the transaction.  \\nLeases \\nGPF recognises all identifiable lease agreements as a lease \\nliability and a corresponding right- of-use asset, with the following \\nexemptions:  \\n• short- term leases (defined as 12 months or less)  \\n• low value assets  \\n \\nFor these leases, GPF recognises the lease payments as other \\noperating expenses in the statement of profit or loss when they \\nincur.  \\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the \\nlease payments for the right to use the underlying as set during \\nthe lease term. The lease term represents the non -cancellable \\nperiod of the lease, together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease when GPF is reasonably certain to exercise this option, and periods covered by an option to termina te the \\nlease if GPF is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.  \\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the \\ncarrying amount to reflect the interest on the lease liability, \\nreducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments  \\nmade and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment of lease modifications, or to reflect adjustments in \\nlease payments due to an adjustment in an index or rate.  \\nThe lease liabilities are included in the accounting line Other \\nliabilities in the financial statement.  \\nThe right -of-use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising \\nthe amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability.  \\nThe right -of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciations \\nare according to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, except \\nthat the right -of-use asset is depreciated over the earlier of the \\nlease term and the remaining useful life of the right -of-use asset. \\nIAS 36 Impairment of Assets applies to determine whether the \\nright-of-use asset is impaired and to account for any impairment \\nloss identified.  \\nThe right -of-use assets are included in the accounting line Right -\\nof-use property.   \\nThe interest effect of discounting the lease liability is presented \\nseparately from the depreciation charge for the right- of-use \\nasset. The depreciation expense is presented with other \\ndepreciations, whereas the interest effect of discounting is \\npresented as a financial item.  \\nIntangible assets \\nInternally developed soft ware  \\nInternally developed software that are acquired separately or as \\na group are recognised at historical cost less accumulated \\namortisation and accumulated impairment losses. New \\nintangible assets are capitalized only if future economic benefits  \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n13 associated wi th the asset are probable and the cost of the asset \\ncan be measured reliably.  \\nDevelopment expenditures (both internally and externally \\ngenerated) is capitalized only if the development expenditure \\ncan be measured reliably, the product or process is techni cally \\nand commercially feasible, future economic benefits are \\nprobable, and the Company intends to and has sufficient \\nresources to complete the development and to use or sell the \\nasset.  \\nAmortisation  \\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill is amortised on a  straight-\\nline basis over the estimated useful life, from the date that they \\nare available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current \\nand comparative periods are as follows  \\n• internally developed software     1–3 years  \\n \\nThe amortisation period and am ortisation method are \\nreassessed annually. An impairment loss is recognised if the \\ncarrying amount of an asset is less than the recoverable amount.  \\nTechnical provisions \\nPremium provision  \\nThe premium reserve comprises income savings deposits, reserves to cover future liabilities for incurred insurance cases \\nand premium reserves for pensions (defined benefit pension with \\nguaranteed return) and unearned premiums. Claims reserves \\nare provisions for claims incurred but not reported.   \\nThe premium reserve represe nts the present value of the \\ncompany\\'s total insurance obligations including future \\nadministration costs, less the present value of future premiums. \\nAdministration reserves are allocated and included in the \\npremium reserve to cover future administrative costs related to \\npensions and waivers under payment. Likewise, a provision for \\nadministration cost are reserved related to the paid -up policy \\nportfolio.  \\nClaim reserves are to cover both anticipated future payments for \\noccurrences that have incurred, but not approved. This includes \\nboth cases reported but not settled (RBNS) and claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). RBNS reserves are assessed \\nindividually, while IBNR provisions are based on empirical data.  \\nIBNR provisions are determined by historical num bers and \\nestimated reporting patterns. IBNR reserves may also be \\nstrengthened through the reinsurance agreements with Gjensidige Forsikring ASA.  \\nIn case of a claim occurrence a provision is made equal to the \\nnet present value of future payments.  \\nProvision in the investment option portfolio  \\nThe premium reserves to cover liabilities related the investment \\noption portfolio must always equal the value of the investment \\nportfolio assigned to the contracts. The company is not exposed to investment risk on custom ers\\' funds as the company is not \\nobliged to provide a minimum return.  \\nValue adjustment provision  \\nThe current year’s net unrealised gains/losses on financial \\nassets at fair value in the group portfolio are allocated \\nto/reversed from the market value adjustm ent reserve in the \\nstatement of financial position assuming the portfolio has a net \\nunrealised excess value. Pursuant to accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS 4) the market value adjustment \\nreserve is shown as a liability.  \\n \\nAdditional statutory  provision  \\nThe company is allowed to make allocations to the additional \\nstatutory reserves to ensure the solvency of its life insurance \\nbusiness . The reserves are a conditional allocation to \\npolicyholders, to be done when the financial return exceeds the guaranteed interest, and may be used later to meet shortfall \\nrelated to fulfilling guaranteed returns. Use of reserves for a year is limited to the equivalent of one year\\'s interest guarantee for \\neach contract.  \\nPremium Fund, Deposit Fund and Fund for Pension \\nAdjustment  \\nFund for Pension Adjustment comprises surplus assigned to the \\npremium reserve related to group pensions in payments. The \\nfund is applied each year as a single premium payment to \\nsecure additional benefits for pensioners.  \\nRisk equalisatio n fund  \\nThe company is allowed to allocate up to 50 per cent of the risk \\nresult related to group pensions and paid -up policies to risk \\nequalization fund to cover any future negative risk result. The \\nrisk equalization fund shall be classified as equity and is included \\nas part of restricted equity.\\n \\nReinsurers’ share of gross insurance -related liabilities  \\nReinsurers’ share of insurance- related liabilities in general \\ninsurance, gross is classified as an asset in the balance sheet. \\nReinsurers’ share of provision for unearned premiums, gross \\nand reinsurers’ share of claims provision, gross are included in \\nreinsurers’ share of insurance -related liabilities in general -\\ninsurance,  \\nFinancial instruments in the insurance \\nbusiness \\nFinancial instruments are classified in one of the following \\ncategories  \\n• fair value through profit or loss  \\n• loans and receivables  \\n• financial liabilities at amortised cost \\n \\nRecognition and derecognition \\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised when GPF \\nbecomes a party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Initial \\nrecognition is at fair value. For instruments that are not derivatives or measured at fair value through profit or loss, \\ntransaction expenses that are directly attributable to the \\nacquisition or issuance of the financial asset or the financial liability, are inclu ded. Normally the initial recognition value will be \\nequal to the transaction price. Subsequent to initial recognition the instruments are measured as described below.  \\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to \\ncash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the Group \\ntransfers the financial asset in a transaction where all or \\npractically all the risk and rewards related to ownership of the \\nassets are transferred.  \\nAt fair value through profit or loss  \\nFinancial assets and liabilities  are classified at fair value through \\nprofit or loss if they are held for trading or are designated as \\nsuch upon initial recognition. All financial assets and liabilities \\ncan be designated at fair value through profit or loss if  \\n• the classification reduces  a mismatch in measurement or \\nrecognition that would have arisen otherwise as a result \\nof different rules for the measurement of assets and \\nliabilities  \\n• the financial assets are included in a portfolio that is \\nmeasured and evaluated regularly at fair value \\n \\nTransaction expenses are recognised in profit or loss when they \\nincur. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are \\nmeasured at fair value at the reporting date. Changes in fair \\nvalue are recognised in profit or loss. \\nThe category at fair val ue through profit or loss comprises the \\nclasses shares and similar interests and bonds and other fixed \\nincome assets.   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n14 Investments held to maturity  \\nInvestments held to maturity are non- derivative financial assets \\nwith payments that are fixed or which can be determined in \\naddition to a fixed maturity date, in which a business has \\nintentions and ability to hold to maturity with the exception of  \\n• those that the business designates as at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss at initial recognition  \\n• those that meet the definition of loans and receivables  \\n \\nInvestments held to maturity are measured at amortised cost \\nusing the effective interest method, less any im pairment losses.  \\nThe category investments held to maturity comprises the class \\nbonds held to maturity.  \\nLoans and receivables \\nLoans and receivables are non -derivative financial assets with \\npayments that are fixed or determinable. Loans and receivables \\nare m easured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod, less any impairment losses. The category loans and \\nreceivables comprises bonds classified as loans.  \\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost  \\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. When the time horizon of the financial \\nliability’s due time is quite near in time the nominal interest rate is \\nused when measuring amortised cost.  \\nThe category financial liabilities at amortised cost comprises the \\nsubo rdinated debt.  \\nDefinition of fair value  \\nSubsequent to initial recognition, investments at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss are measured at the amount each \\nasset/liability can be settled to in an orderly transaction between market participants at the meas urements date.  \\nDifferent valuation techniques and methods are used to estimate \\nfair value depending on the type of financial instruments and to \\nwhich extent they are traded in active markets. For financial \\ninstruments traded in active markets, listed marke t prices or \\ntraders\\' prices are used, while for financial instruments not traded in an active market, fair value is determined using appropriate valuation methods.  \\nFor further description of fair value, see note 12.  \\nDefinition of amortised cost  \\nSubsequent to initial recognition, investments held to maturity, \\nloans and receivables and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value are measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. When calculating effective interest \\nrate, future c ash flows are estimated, and all contractual terms of \\nthe financial instrument are taken into consideration. Fees paid \\nor received between the parties in the contract and transaction \\ncosts that are directly attributable to the transaction, are included as an integral component of determining the effective interest \\nrate. \\nLoans, receivables and investments held to maturity For financial assets that are not measured at fair value, an \\nassessment of whether there is objective evidence that there \\nhas been a reduc tion in the value of a financial asset or group of \\nassets is made on each reporting date. Objective evidence might \\nbe information about credit report alerts, defaults, issuer or \\nborrower suffering significant financial difficulties, bankruptcy or \\nobservabl e data indicating that there is a measurable reduction \\nin future cash flows from a group of financial assets, even \\nthough the reduction cannot yet be linked to an individual asset.  \\nAn assessment is first made to whether objective evidence of \\nimpairment of financial assets that are individually significant \\nexists. Financial assets that are not individually significant or that \\nare assessed individually, but not impaired, are assessed in groups with respect to impairment. Assets with similar credit risk \\ncharac teristics are grouped together.  \\nIf there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, \\nimpairment loss are calculated as the difference between the \\ncarrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated \\nfuture cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. \\nThe loss is recognised in profit or loss.  \\nImpairment losses are reversed if the reversal can be related \\nobjectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was \\nrecognised. The reversal shall not result in the carrying amount \\nof the financial asset exceeding the amount of the amortised \\ncost if the impairment had not been recognised at the time the \\nloss was reversed. Reversal of previous losses on impairment is recognised in profit or loss.  \\nProvisions \\nProvisions are recognised when the company has a legal or \\nconstructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable \\nthat this will entail the payment or transfer of other assets to \\nsettle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  \\nInformation about contingent assets are disclosed where an \\ninflow of economic benefits is probable. Information about a \\ncontingent liability is disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources is remote.  \\nEvents after the balance sheet date \\nNew information of the financial position after the balance sheet date is taken into the annual accounts. Events after the balance \\nsheet date that do not affect the company\\'s financial position at \\nthe balance sheet date but which will affect the co mpany\\'s \\nfinancial position in the future are disclosed if this is material  \\nPensions \\nPension liabilities are assessed at the present value of future \\npension benefits that are recognised as accrued at the reporting \\ndate. Future pension benefits are calculate d on the basis of \\nexpected salary at the retirement date. Pension assets are \\nvalued at fair value. Net pension liability is the difference \\nbetween the present value of future pension benefits and the fair value of the pension assets. Employer\\'s social security cost is \\nrecognised during the period under which an underfunding \\noccurs. Net pension liability is shown in the balance sheet on the \\nline Pension liabilities. Any overfunding is recognised to the \\nextent that it is likely that the overfunding can be uti lised. An \\noverfunding in a funded plan cannot be offset against an \\nunderfunding in an unfunded plan. If there is a net overfunding in \\nthe funded plan, it is recognised as Pension assets.  \\nThe period\\'s pension cost (service cost) and net interest \\nexpense (income) are recognised in the income statement and are presented as an operating cost in the income statement. Net \\ninterest expense is calculated using the discount rate for the \\nliability at the beginning of the period of the net liability. Net interest expense therefore consists of interest on the obligation \\nand return on the assets.  \\nDeviations between estimated pension liability and estimated \\nvalue of pension assets in the previous financial year and \\nactuarial pension liability and fair value of pension ass ets at the \\nbeginning of the year are recognised in other comprehensive \\nincome. These will never be reclassified through profit or loss.  \\nGains and losses on curtailment or settlement of a defined \\nbenefit plan are recognised in the income statement at the ti me \\nof the curtailment or settlement.  \\nDeductible grants to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee expenses in the income statement when accrued.  \\n   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n15 Share-based payment  \\nGjensidige has a share saving program for employees and a \\nshare -based remuneration scheme for senior executives. The \\nshare savings program is an arrangement with settlement in \\nshares, while the remuneration scheme is an arrangement with \\nsettlement in both shares and cash. \\nThe share -based payment arrangement are measured at fair \\nvalue at the time of allocation and are not changed afterwards. \\nFair value is accrued over the period during which employees \\nacquire the right to receive the shares. Share -based payment \\narrangements which are recovered immediately are recognised \\nas expenses  at the time of allocation. Vesting conditions are \\ntaken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, \\nultimately, the amount recognised shall be based on the number \\nof equity inst ruments that eventually vest. Non- vesting \\nconditions are reflected in the measurement of fair value, and no \\nadjustment of the amount recognised as expenses is done upon \\nfailing to meet such conditions.  \\nThe cost of share -based transactions with employees is  \\nrecognised as an expense over the average recovery period. \\nFor arrangements that are settled in shares, the value of the \\nallocated shares in the period is recognised as a salary expense \\nin the income statement with a corresponding increase in other \\npaid-in equity. For arrangements settled in cash, which is only \\napplicable for Gjensidige’s obligation to withhold an amount for the employees’ tax liability and transfer this amount in cash to the tax authorities on behalf of the employee, the value of the \\noptions granted is recognised as a salary expense in the income \\nstatement with a corresponding increase in other paid -in equity. . \\nEmployers\\' social security costs are calculated based on the fair value of the shares on each balance sheet date. The amount is \\nrecognised in the income statement over the expected vesting \\nperiod and accrued according to IAS 37.  \\nShare -based payment arrangements settled by one of the \\nshareholders in the ultimate mother company is also recognised as a share -based payment transaction with settlement in equity.  \\nSee note 25 for a further description of share -based payment \\narrangements and their measurement method . Tax \\nIncome tax expense comprises the total of current tax and \\ndeferred tax.  \\nCurrent tax  \\nCurrent tax is tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, \\nbased on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the \\nreporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of \\nprevious years.  \\nDeferred tax Deferred tax is determined based on differences between the \\ncarrying amount and the amounts used for taxation purposes, of \\nassets and liabilities at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. \\nDeferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deduc tible \\ntemporary differences to the extent that it is probable that they \\ncan be offset by future taxable income. If deferred tax arises in \\nconnection with the initial recognition of a liability or asset \\nacquired in a transaction that is not a business combi nation, and \\nit does not affect the financial or taxable profit or loss at the time \\nof the transaction, then it will not be recognised.  \\nRecognition  \\nCurrent tax and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or \\nincome in the income statement, with the excepti on of deferred \\ntax on items that are recognised in other comprehensive income, \\nwhere the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income, or in cases where deferred tax arises as a result of a business \\ncombination.   \\nRelated party transactions  \\nThe provider of intra- group services, that are not considered \\ncore activities, will as a main rule, allocate its incurred net costs \\n(all costs included) based on Cost Plus method, which includes \\ndirect and indirect costs, as well as a mark -up for profit.  \\nIdentified functions that are categorized as core activities will be \\ncharged out with a reasonable mark up or alternatively at market \\nprice if identifiable, comparable prices exist.  \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n16 2. Risk and capital management\\nIntroduction \\nGjensidige Pensjonsforsikring’s (GPF) core business is life \\ninsurance and its business are exposed to insurance risk and \\nfinancial risk.  \\nFigure 1 –  Business structure \\n \\n \\nIn this note, the effects of Covid- 19 will be described first. Then \\nthe risk management system is presented. Then the different \\nrisks and the management of these risks, will be described. \\nFinally , the capital requirement for these risks and the capital \\nmanagement will be described.  \\nCovid-19 \\nThe outbreak of the corona virus, Covid- 19, and the measures \\ntaken to limit infection have had limited financial consequences \\nfor the financial year 2020. The pension business is mainly \\nexposed to the effects of the outbreak through a reduction in \\nassets under management, an increase in dis ability cases, \\ndismissals and bankruptcies. In addition are the daily operations \\naffected.  \\nChanges in assets under management had an immediate impact \\non revenues. As the financial markets have recovered after the \\ndrop last spring, assets under management at the end of 2020 \\nare at a higher level than before the outbreak. The effects of \\nincreased disability cases are usually visible first after more than \\na year due to an extensive assessment and treatment process. \\nTerminations and bankruptcies have no signifi cant immediate \\nimpact as the capital remains invested. Long term, both \\nincreased disability and an increase in redundancies / \\nbankruptcies, may have a negative impact on the company\\'s \\nearnings.  \\nThe majority of the company’s employees have worked from home throughout the covid- 19 period. The daily operations have \\nbeen running basically as normal, and there is reason to believe that this situation will persist going forward, even if the \\ngovernment measures are prolonged. Through extensive use of \\nhome offices,  outbreaks are considered to have a limited effect. \\nShould employees still be infected by covid- 19, emergency plans \\nhave been prepared, and the company\\'s emergency preparedness has been in full operation throughout the covid -19 \\nperiod.  Risk management system  \\nThe risk management system is organized on the basis of three \\nlines and is an integrated part of the corporate governance \\nsystem for GPF.  \\nFigure 2 –  The Corporate Governance system of Gjensidige \\nPensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n \\n \\nThe primary responsibility for risk management and internal \\ncontrol is held by GPF’s CEO and all employees and leaders in \\nthe company. This is called the first line. There are established procedures and guidelines that must be followed, and risk \\nmanagement and internal control are therefore performed as a \\npart of all employee’s daily work. Control functions in line \\nmanagement are incorporated into the overall internal control \\nsystem. Such functions include risk and compliance \\ncoordinators, security, data privacy office r, anti -money laundry \\nofficer and quality functions reviewing distribution and claims \\nhandling.  \\nThe second line is carried through by centralized control \\nfunctions for risk management, compliance, actuary and \\nsecurity.  \\nThe risk management function is responsible for monitoring and \\ndeveloping GPF’s risk management and internal control system. In addition, the function has an overview of the risks GPF is or \\nmay be exposed to, and what this means for the company’s \\nsolvency. The risk management function is  headed by the Risk \\nManager. The Risk Manager has an independent reporting line \\nto the CEO. Requirements for risk management are specified in \\nthe risk management and internal control policy and in the \\nORSA policy, both of which have been approved by the Bo ard. \\nThe compliance function shall detect and prevent risks related to \\ncompliance with external and internal regulations. The \\ncompliance function is headed by the Compliance Officer.  \\nGroup security is responsible for establishing, implementing, \\noperating,  monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving the \\ninformation security management system. The security function \\nis headed by the Chief Security Officer.  \\nThe actuarial function is responsible for coordinating the \\ncalculation and control of the technical  provisions. The \\nresponsibility is centralized in the Group‘s Actuary department, \\nwhich is headed by the Chief Actuary of Gjensidige Forsikring \\nASA. Even though the actuarial function is organized in the Group’s Actuary department, its responsibility is li mited to \\ncontrolling activities. Group’s Actuary department has no responsibility for developing claim provision models and regular claim provision calculations, which ensures independence of the \\nactuarial function.  \\nAll control functions in the second line report directly to the CEO \\non subject matters. \\n \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n17 The third line is the group’s internal audit function, which \\nmonitors risk management and the internal control system. The audit function reports directly to the Board of GPF.  \\nFigure 3 –  Operational structure  \\n \\n \\nThe risk management system presented above is implemented and the Board has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the \\nlevel of risk -taking in the company is satisfactory relative to \\nGPF’s financial strength and risk willingn ess. The Board has \\nadopted a risk appetite statement that covers the most important types of risks. This entails ensuring that necessary governing \\ndocuments, procedures and reporting are in place in order to secure satisfactory risk management, compliance with laws and \\nregulations and the appropriate organization and documentation \\nof risk management and internal control efforts.  \\nGPF has established strategies, policies, guidelines, routines and authorization rules for main risk areas. Policies are subject \\nto approval by the Board. \\n \\nInsurance risk \\nRisk description  \\nGPF is exposed to life insurance risk. GPF has a relatively large \\nrisk appetite within occupational defined contribution plans, \\ncollective disability and survivor benefits , moderate risk appetite \\nwithin individual disability plans and low risk appetite within \\ncapital -intensive and complicated products (paid- up defined \\nbenefit policies). In order to describe life insurance risk, the most \\nimportant components are elaborated below, and these are \\ndisabi lity, longevity, mortality, catastrophe, lapse and expense \\nrisk.  \\nDisability risk  \\nDisability risk is the risk that actual disability is higher than expected and/or that the recovery is lower than expected. Higher \\ndisability rates, but also lower recovery rates will increase the \\nclaim payments. Both individual and collective disability products \\nexpose GPF to disability risk. Apart  from lapse risk disability risk \\nis one of the major insurance risks for GPF.  \\nLongevity risk  \\nLongevity risk is the risk of lower  mortality rates than expected. \\nLower mortality will result in a higher total of pension payments \\nfor guaranteed products. The company cannot charge additional \\npremium for contractual  periods previously entered into . The risk \\nfor the company is that the pr ovisions that shall cover all future \\nclaims are insufficient.  \\n \\nGPF is especially exposed to longevity risk linked to  the paid -up \\npolicies, where GPF is liable to pay a defined benefit until death \\nor other agreed upon period.  \\nMortality risk  \\nMortality risk  is the risk of higher mortality rates than expected. It \\nis defined as a permanent increase in mortality  rates  for all ages. \\nHigher mortality rates will result in higher claim payments to the surviving spouse or children . Mortality risk in GPF is low as there is a limited amount of policies covering mortality risk. In addition,  \\nmortality rates are low, so increased mortality  will have limited \\nimpact. This means that increased mortality is not the dominant \\nrisk for GPF, but the risk of decreased mortality; longevity risk.  \\nCatastrophe risk  \\nCatastrophe risk is defined as the risk of an immediate increase \\nin mortality due to a catastrophic event . Mortality risk is in \\ngeneral low, and the catastrophe scenario for catastrophe risk will have a very small impact on GPF’s portfolio.  \\nLapse risk  \\nLapse risk is the risk of an increase in lapse rates , i.e. the risk of \\nan increase in customers leaving the company. This is mainly  \\nrelevant in Solvency II aspects, because  Solvency II takes into \\naccount expected future profit. Lapse risk reflects the risk of a \\npotential reduction of the expected future profit if customers leave the company. Lapse risk is mainly related to unit linked \\nproducts  and represents an important risk for the company  in \\nSolvency II.  If a large number of customers choose to leave the \\ncompany it would lead to a loss of assets under management and expected future profit, but at the same time risk will be \\nreduced.  \\nExpense risk  \\nExpense risk is the risk of actual  expenses being higher than \\nexpected. The risk is related to the administration result which is \\nthe expected administration income minus the expected \\nexpenses for the whole lifetime of the products that fall within the \\nscope of the contract. Expense risk is greater in Solvency II \\naspects , because the contract boundary  is longer. For some \\nproducts, GPF cannot increase the administration fee if the \\nexpenses increase (e.g. guaranteed paid -up policies). For other \\nproducts, the company  can increase the administr ation fee for \\nthe future and thereby reduce the losses.  \\nRisk Exposure  \\nGPF offers several disability pension products and for this reason disability risk is a material risk. In addition, longevity risk \\nis a substantial risk because of the portfolio of paid up policies. If \\nrisk is measured according to Solvency II principles, then lapse \\nrisk is the dominating risk. This is  the case in Solvency II \\nbecause future profit is accounted for .  \\nThe table below shows the risk exposure to insurance risk of GPF in Solvency II.  \\nTable 1 –  Risk exposure within insurance risk (based on the \\nstandard formula according to Solvency II principles)  \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nType of insurance risk    \\nLongevity risk  5.2 %  2.6 %  \\nDisability risk  6.6 %  1.6 %  \\nLapse risk  82.7 %  93.5 %  \\nExpenses risk  5.5 %  2.3 %  \\nTotal  100.0 %  100.0 %  \\n   \\nInsurance risk  1,067.0  1,867.6  \\n \\nRisk Concentration  \\nLife insurance consists of policies in the Norwegian market. The \\nportfolio mainly  consists  of small and medium -sized commercial \\ncustomers all over the  country, and  in different industries. Risk \\nconcentration is therefore considered to be  limited.  \\nManaging insurance risk \\nAn underwriting policy approved by the Board gives guidelines for fundamental principles and responsibilities in product and \\ntariff development, ri sk selection and determination of the terms \\nand pricing of individual risks. The Product department has \\noverall responsibility for the management of the underwriting \\npolicy.  \\n \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n18 GPF has an actuarial function, placed in Gjensidige Forsikring \\nASA. Having the ac tuarial function as a common second line of \\ndefense for the Group ensures that all parts of the organization \\nuse the same principles and models for the calculation of \\ntechnical provisions.  \\nThe Product department is holding regular meetings together with t he rest of GPF management and actuarial function to \\ncapture the level of technical provisions and changes in the \\ndevelopment of reported claims. This includes communication in \\nrespect of product and process changes, etc., that could affect \\nthe level.  \\nThe m ain documents for managing insurance risks are:  \\n• Underwriting policy  \\n• Guidelines for product development  \\n• Guidelines for underwriting  \\n• Policy for technical provisions  \\n• Guidelines for calculating and reporting technical \\nprovisions  \\n• Capital management policy  \\n \\nIn addition, more specific requirements on managing insurance \\nrisk are given in underlying guidelines and instructions.  \\nRisk mitigation  \\nGPF buys reinsurance for disability risk from Gjensidige Forsikring ASA as protection against large number of claims \\n(stop loss) and high single claim (excess of loss).  \\nIn addition,  GPF signed a quota share re insurance contract with \\nSwiss Re covering disability risk associated with child insurance.  \\nIn 2020 GPF entered into a reinsurance agreement with \\nGjensidige Forsikring which protects against loss in case of \\nmass lapse.  \\nFinancial risk \\nRisk description  \\nFinancial risk is the risk of experiencing losses due to changes in \\nmacroeconomic conditions and/or changes in financial asset \\nvalues and liabilities. GPF is exposed to these types of risk through the Company’s investment activities. The risk is \\nmanaged at the aggregate level and handled through the policy \\nfor investment activities and investment strategies.  \\nGPF manages investment option portfolio, group policy portfolio \\nand company portfolio, and those have various exposures to \\nfinancial risk.  \\nInvestment option portfolio  \\nDefined contributions schemes are the core product of GPF, \\nwhich offers three main options for its customers: active, \\ncombined and index asset management. In all options \\ncustomers can choose between different risk profiles: safe, \\nbalanced, offensive and age -appropriate.  \\nFor Unit Linked products, the market risk is held by the \\ncustomer, but GPF is indirectly exposed, since a part of the total \\nincome depends on the amount of assets under management.  \\nGroup policy portfolio  \\nFor guaranteed products GPF carries the market risk, since these products have a guaranteed annual return rate, in \\naccordance with Norwegian insurance rules.  For some of the \\nguaranteed products, certain future discretionary benefits (e.g. \\nadditional statutory reserves) have a loss absorbing effect as \\nthese assets can be used to cover the difference between the actual investment return and the guaranteed return. The main \\nrisk elements related to the group portfolio are interest rates, \\ncredit and property risk. There is no exposure to equity market \\nrisk. The portfolio exposes the company’s equity for potential \\nloss. Company portfolio  \\nThe risk profile in the company portfolio is conservative and \\nconsists mainly of short dated money market instruments, loan \\nand receivables to amortized cost and bank deposits. \\nGPF has its own exposure in financial instruments through the \\ntrading book. This is a technically calculated portfolio that arises \\nmainly as a result of internal processing time for the purchase \\nand sale of fund units on behalf of the customers. The book \\nvalue of this portfolio at the end of 2020 was NOK 0.3 million. \\nMost of this is a result of the time it takes  from the order being \\nplaced until it is executed. The real trading portfolio at the end of \\n2020 was NOK 1.8 million  \\nTable 2 –  Asset allocation excluding the unit -linked portfolio  \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nFixed income- short duration  1,493.4  1,325.6  \\nBank deposits  167.1  142.2  \\nLoan and receivables  5,718.7  5,246.3  \\nCurrent bonds  84.8 249.9  \\nEquities  3.7 6.3 \\nReal estate 1,036.4  958.2  \\nTotal  8,504.1  7,928.5  \\n \\nRisk exposure \\nThe table below shows the risk exposure to market risk of GPF in Solvency II.  \\nTable 3 –  Risk exposure within market risk (based on the \\nstandard formula according to Solvency II principles)  \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nType of market risk    \\nInterest rate risk  12.7%  11.2%  \\nEquity risk  33.0%  36.7%  \\nProperty risk  17.0%  16.2%  \\nSpread risk  37.2%  35.8%  \\nCurrency risk  0.0%  0.0%  \\nConcentration risk  0.0%  0.1%  \\nTotal  100.0%  100.0%  \\n   \\nMarkets risk  1,333.3  1,346.5  \\n \\nSpread risk  \\nSpread risk measures sensitivity of the values of assets, \\nliabilities and financial instruments to changes in the level or \\nvolatility of credit spreads over the risk -free interest rate term \\nstructure. It is the fixed income portfolio that is exposed to \\nspread risk. For the Group portfolio a major part of the \\ninvestments are in loans and receivables.  \\nThe tables below show allocation of the fixed- income portfolio \\nper sector and per rating category as per December 31, 20 20 for \\nGPF.  \\nTable 4 –  Allocation of the fixed -income portfolio per sector  \\n \\n 2020  2019  \\n   \\nGovernment bonds  16.5%  9.0%  \\nCorporate bonds  83.5%  91.0%  \\nTotal  100.0%  100.0%  \\n \\n   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n19 Table 5 –  Allocation of the fixed -income portfolio per rating \\ncategory  \\n 2020  2019  \\n   \\nAAA 33.6%  30.9%  \\nAA 10.6%  7.9%  \\nA 18.6%  18.0%  \\nBBB 15.8%  12.1%  \\nBB 0.0%  0.0%  \\nB 0.0%  0.0%  \\nCCC or lower  0.0%  0.0%  \\nNot rated  21.4%  31.1%  \\nTotal  100.0%  100.0%  \\n \\nAs can be seen from the table, a significant part of the \\nNorwegian fixed -income portfolio consists of issuers without a \\nrating from an official rating company.  \\nEquity risk \\nEquity risk measures sensitivity of the values of assets, liabilities \\nand financial instruments to changes in the level or volatility of market prices of equities.  \\nThere are  no equities in the assets related to guaranteed \\nbusiness and thus no equity risk within these. Regarding Unit \\nLinked products, approximately 60 % of the assets within these \\nproducts are allocated to equities (mostly global equities), and \\nan equity shock s cenario would decrease the assets under \\nmanagement significantly. Since a part of the management fee \\nis proportionate to the assets under management, an equity \\nshock scenario would decrease the income of GPF and result in \\na reduction of future profits.  \\nThe equity exposures are mainly investments in internationally \\ndiversified funds, with the majority focusing on developed \\nmarkets.  \\nProperty risk  \\nProperty risk measures sensitivity of value of assets, liabilities \\nand financial instruments to changes in the level or volatility of \\nmarket prices of property. Property constitutes a significant \\nproportion of the group policy portfolios. Independently of the legal organization of the exposure, the underlying investments in \\nproperty are assessed with respect to risk. The valuation \\nprinciples in the fund are based on the guidelines laid down in \\ninternational valuation standards IVS and EVS as well as \\ngenerally recognized valuation principles. The valuation of an \\nindividual property is based on discounting estimated fut ure cash \\nflows, which in turn is estimated based on several specific \\nanalyzed market conditions in the real estate market, such as \\nmarket rent, operating costs, investment level and expected vacancy in the real estate market, as well as individual \\nproperti es. The discount rate is made up of long -term \\ngovernment interest rates, underlying property risk and a \\nsubjective risk adjustment that is intended to reflect deviations \\nfrom the average for the individual property. Underlying property \\nrisk is measured as the gap between long- term government \\ninterest rates and \"prime yield\". Subjective risk adjustments are \\nderived from known transactions with comparable properties. \\nFinally, inflation estimates from Statistics Norway are used as a \\nbasis for deriving a nominal discount rate.  \\nThe motivation for investing in real estate is primarily that it \\nenhances the risk -adjusted return of the asset portfolio through \\nan expected rate of return that lies between bonds and equities \\nwith a modest correlation in returns with both of them. \\nThe portfolio consists of investment properties. The real estate \\nportfolio has its largest concentration of offices in the Oslo area.  \\nInterest rate risk\\n \\nInterest rate risk measures sensitivity of value of assets, \\nliabilities and financial instruments to changes in the term \\nstructure of interest rates or interest rate volatility.  For GPF the interest rate risk is substantial in the management \\nof the group policy portfolios. The exposure to interest rate risk is reduced by increasing the total duration of the portfolio of \\nfixed- income instruments, including short- term bonds and \\nloans and receivables. From an accounting perspective, the \\nrisk is reduced since a large part of the bond portfolio is \\nclassified as loans and receivables. \\nIn a market value perspective on the asset and liability side, the \\ninterest rate risk will be considerable because of the duration deviation between the asset and liability sides.  \\nExpected payout pattern for GPF\\'s technical provisions is shown \\nin the figu re below.  \\nFigure 4 –  Expected payout pattern for the insurance \\ntechnical provisions  \\n \\n \\n \\nTable 6 –  Maturity profile (year) on interest -bearing \\ninstruments  \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nMaturity    \\n0-1 913.1  977.6  \\n1-2 444.4  148.4  \\n2-3 170.6  444.2  \\n3-4 117.3  170.3  \\n4-5 96.7 117.5  \\n5-6 321.6  96.6 \\n6-7 1,476.7  321.8  \\n7-8 508.6  1,446.7  \\n8-9 468.1  508.6  \\n9-10 656.8  468.1  \\n>10 1,058.3  1,168.4  \\nTotal  6,232.2  5,868.4  \\n \\nThe interest rate risk arises in the Group policy portfolio which \\nguarantees an annual investment return. A decrease in the \\ninterest rate level increases the risk of not achieving the \\nguaranteed investment return. Today\\'s interest rate level is below the guaranteed interest rate. So far, GPF has achieved a \\nsatisfactory return, but as the inv estment portfolio matures, \\nreinvestment will take place at the current low interest rate level, \\nwith a lower expected return. Further decrease in the interest \\nrate will make it more difficult to find investments that provide a \\nsufficient return to achieve the annual return guarantee.  \\nRegarding unit linked products, an interest rate downward shock would increase the assets under management and thus increase \\nthe income from asset management. A change in the discount \\ncurve would also increase the net asset val ue of future profits. \\nAs a consequence, the unit linked portfolio has a somewhat \\npositive effect in a scenario with a decrease in the interest rate \\ncurve, which compensates for some of the increased risk arising \\non the guaranteed products.  \\n \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n20 Following the fi nancial crisis in 2008, efforts have been made to \\nreform the structure around IBOR (Interbank Borrowing Rates) \\nand replace it with other benchmark interest rates. Changes in \\nbenchmark interest rates are assumed to have little effect on \\nGPF and the company does not have individual financial \\ninstruments and products priced with LIBOR as a benchmark.  \\nAs regards NIBOR, EURIBOR and CIBOR, a transition to new \\nbenchmark interest rates is further ahead. In any new \\nagreements where either NIBOR, EURIBOR or CIBOR is used \\nas a reference, formulations must be incorporated that take into \\naccount a possible transition to alternative reference rates. So \\nfar, no plan has been made for phasing out NIBOR, but the \\ncontrol mechanism around the banks\\' quotas of the NIBOR \\ninteres t rate has been more formalized. Nor have the Eurozone \\ncountries, Sweden or Denmark made any decision to phase out \\ntheir IBOR interest rates. GPF is following the development.  \\nThe risk exposure related to financial instruments as a result of \\nthe transition is considered to be very low. The IBOR reform will \\nnot change the risk management strategy.  \\nForeign exchange risk \\nForeign exchange risk measures sensitivity of value of assets, \\nliabilities  and financial instruments to changes in the level of \\nvolatility of currency exchange rates. \\nForeign exchange risk in the Group policy portfolio is hedged \\n100 per cent by using funds that are hedged to NOK.  \\nFor unit linked products the customers can choos e between \\nhedged and unhedged products. Fixed income products are \\nalways hedged.  \\nCounterparty default risk  \\nCounterparty default risk reflects possible losses due to \\nunexpected default of the counterparties and debtors of GPF . \\nGPF are exposed to counterparty risk through the investments in \\nsecurities, funds, bank deposits , and through receivables from \\nintermediaries and reinsurance contracts.  \\nLiquidity risk  \\nLiquidity risk is defined as the inability to meet payments when \\ndue, or by the need to realise investments at a high cost to meet \\npayments. Limits have been set for the necessary access to \\nliquid funds. These are monitored continually and are taken \\ninto account in the strategic asset allocation. Liquidity risk is \\nconsidered low. A liquidity strategy has been prepared, which \\nis approved by the Board on an annual basis.  \\nRisk Concentration \\nThe definition of risk concentrations regarding financial \\ninvestments is risk regarding the accumulation of exposures  \\nwithin the same geograp hical area, industry sector etc.  \\nFor GPF sector concentration of fixed income securities are \\nregulated by the Guidelines for credit exposure for GPF and the \\nGroup Credit policy. The Guidelines define a number of industry \\nsectors together with allocation li mits to each sector in order to \\nensure diversification in the total portfolio. The current allocation \\nof fixed income securities in the Group portfolio meets the \\nGuidelines requirement and in the unit link portfolios funds are \\nused in the allocation.  \\nIn the unit link portfolios, the equity investments are investments \\nin internationally diversified funds and Norwegian funds. \\nInvestments are mainly in developed markets. The degree of diversification, both for sector and geographical concentration, is \\nthus dependent of the composition in the fund structure.  \\nFixed income funds consist of internationally and Norwegian \\ndiversified funds in asset classes like investment grade and high yield.  Managing financial risk \\nMonitoring, quantification, management and control of risk \\nexposure are an important part of GPF’s business that is carried \\nout to ensure that the risk level is reasonable and to support value creation. Overall risk management ensures that different \\nrisks are assessed and handled in a consistent manner. The \\npurpose of risk management in GPF is twofold. Firstly, it is \\nintended to ensure that the exposure does not exceed the \\ncapacity for risk. Secondly, overall risk management is intended \\nto contribute to value creation for customers and the owner within th e adopted risk appetite.  \\nThe Board yearly approves the investment strategy with limits for \\nthe various types of risk and asset allocation.   \\nThe Company has set limits for credit exposure based on Group \\ncredit limits. Credit limits are set for designated c ounterparties. \\nThe limits are based in either the official credit rating of the \\ncounterparty or internal analyses. These are monitored and \\nreported monthly. The management of credit risk is defined in \\nGPF’s credit policy.  \\nThe investment strategy defines se veral risk limits in order to \\nhave a diversified investment portfolio for the Group policy Portfolio. The limits have been set to interest rate risk, ALM -risk, \\nforeign exchange risk and allocation in the investment portfolio. \\nThese limits are reported monthly to the board and monitored.  \\nThe main governing documents for managing market, credit and \\nliquidity risks are:  \\n• Investment strategy for portfolios with equity risk  \\n• Investment strategy for portfolios without equity risk  \\n• Credit policy  \\n• Liquidity Strategy  \\n• Capital management policy  \\n• Policy for investment activities  \\n \\nRisk Mitigation \\nGPF is invested in fixed -income instruments with long duration \\nto reduce the mismatched of the duration of the technical \\nprovisions.  \\nThe company intends to streamline the risk result and avoid \\ntaking financial risk in \"portfolios\" where one cannot get payed for the management and / or the explicit financial risk the \\ncompany takes.  \\nHedging exchange rate exposure  \\nCurrency risk is defined  as the risk of a financial loss as a result \\nof changes in foreign exchange rates. In the group policy portfolio, all the investments are in fixed -income securities \\nissued in NOK or in Norwegian money market funds. For the \\nunit-linked portfolio for corpora te customers, external agents and \\nprivate customers, the equity exposure is normally not currency hedged. But because of market view the investments are currency hedged per 31.12.20 .  Interest rate exposure is \\ncurrency hedged.  \\nRisk Sensitivity \\nThe aim of the sensitivity analysis is to show the effect of \\ndifferent pre -defined scenarios.  \\nThe following assumptions are made for the different risk drivers \\nfor the unit link portfolio:  \\n• Equities: It is assumed that the market value of equities \\nincreases/decreases  \\n• Fixed Income: It is assumed that the market value of fixed \\nincome increases/decreases  \\n \\nFor the group portfolio and the company portfolio the following \\nassumptions are made for the different risk drivers:   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n21 • Equities: It is assumed that the market value of eq uities \\nincreases/decreases  \\n• Interest rate: It is assumed that the yield curve taken as a \\nwhole changes with one percentage point \\n \\nThe tables below show the effect of the different sensitivities  \\n \\nTable 7a – Potential change in value based on different \\nsensitivities.

Operational risk may be due to \\nhuman error, weaknesses in systems, and errors in processes or \\nexternal events. This includes compliance risk. There is a strong correlation between effective internal control and low operational \\nrisk, since internal control is particularly effective for managing \\noperational risk.  \\nAll managers in GPF are responsible for risk within their areas of \\nresponsibility and shall be able to demonstrate that controls are \\nadequate and functioning. Risks shall be regularly updated if \\nthere are changes or events that trigger the risk situation \\nchanges. Quarterly, the risk situation is tested through samples \\npresented for the management group.  \\nThe major operational risks in the business are included in the \\nown risk and solvency assessment (ORSA) and form a part of the annual risk assessment process. \\nOperational risk arising specific ally from financial operations is \\nmonitored and controlled and described in the investment policy \\nadopted by the Board.\\n \\nGPF is subject to governing documents for management of operational risk:  \\n• Policy for risk management and internal control  \\n• Instructions for the management of operational risk  \\n• Instructions for the registration, escalation and reporting \\nof incidents  \\n• Ethical rules for Gjensidige Forsikring Group  \\n \\nManagement of specific types of risk embodied in these \\ngoverning documents:  \\n• Policy – handling of irregularities and fraud  \\n• Policy for processing of personal data \\n• Policy for information security  \\n• Anti-money laundering instructions  \\n Strategic and business risk \\nStrategic risk is the risk of loss due to the inability to establish and implement b usiness plans and strategies, make decisions, \\nallocate resources or respond to changes in the environment.  \\nStrategic risk is recognised as a dedicated risk category in \\nGPF’s risk universe. The most viable tool for managing strategic \\nrisk is a robust strate gy process and a dynamic performance \\nmanagement process integrated with the reporting processes.  \\nStrategic risks in the business are covered in the own risk and \\nsolvency assessment (ORSA).  \\nThe main governing documents for managing strategic risk:  \\n• Management Forecast – a yearly five- year projection of \\nthe business  \\n• Risk appetite, updated and revised annually  \\n• Policy for risk management and internal control  \\n \\nCapital management  \\nThe core function of insurance is the transfer of risk, and GPF is exposed to risk t hrough its insurance and investment operations. \\nThe identification and management of risk is an essential part of \\nits operations. All insurance companies must adapt their risk \\nexposure to their capital base whilst acknowledging that \\nsolvency capital, or equity, has a cost.  \\nA key objective of capital management is to balance these two \\naspects. GPF’s overall capital management objective is to \\nensure that the capitalization of the company can sustain an adverse outcome without giving rise to a financially dis tressed \\nsituation and that the company’s capital is used in the most efficient way.  \\nThe capital management policy specifies the requirements for capital management. This includes a description of the capital \\nmanagement strategy, the organization of capital management \\nand capital reporting.  \\nThe capital management policy has guidelines for the choice of tools within certain areas in order to maximize shareholder value \\nthrough an optimal use of capital. The tools available are:  \\n• Capitalization and capital structure of the company  \\n• Dividend Policy  \\n• Asset allocation  \\n• Reinsurance  \\n• Allocation of capital to products or business units to \\nassess profitability or pricing \\n \\nThe company calculates the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) under the standard method defined by § 14 -10 of the Act \\non financial undertakings. The company has established a traffic light system indicating different levels of solvency capital in relation to the SCR and associated measures . Goal for Solvency \\nmargin is 130 to 145 percent.  \\nRegulatory capital requirement  \\nThe regulatory capital requirement is calculated based on the \\nstandard formula specified in the Solvency II regulation. The \\ncapital requirement for GPF is NOK 1. 4 billion. Eligible capital is \\nNOK 2. 1 billion. This gives a solvency margin of 14 6.2 per cent.  \\nTable 8 –  Regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement   \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nTotal eligible own funds to meet the SCR  2,080.7  2,678.6  \\nSCR 1,423.5  1,909.6  \\nCapital surplus  657.1  769.0  \\nSCR margin  146.2 %  140.3 %  \\n  \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n22 In addition to the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR), there is \\na defined minimum level of capital  (MCR ).In the event of a \\nbreach of MCR, Finanstilsynet will be able to revoke the \\ncompany\\'s license if the company does not meet the \\nrequirement within three months.  \\nTable 9 –  Regulatory Minimum Capital Requirement   \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nAvailable capital to meet MCR  1,906.9  2,500.0  \\nSolvency capital requirement MCR  640.6  628.4  \\nSolvency capital surplus  1,266.3  1,871.6  \\nMCR margin 297.7 %  397.9 %  \\n \\nTotal eligible own funds to meet the SCR is excess of assets \\nover liabilities calculated according to Solvency II principles, \\nadjusted for subordinated liabilities.   \\nTable 10 - Eligible capital to cover the Solvency Capital \\nRequirement  \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nAssets over liabilities according to Solvency \\nII principles  1,778.9  2,374.3  \\nSubordinated liabilities  301.8  304.3  \\nTotal eligible own funds to meet the \\nSCR 2,080.7  2,678.6  \\n The main differences between Solvency II valuation and \\nvaluation according to accounting principles are:  \\n• Intangibles are valued to zero under Solvency II \\n• Bonds are valued to fair value under Solvency II, while \\namortized cost is used for accounting purposes  \\n• Technical provisions are valued differently (see below for \\nmore details)  \\n• Different valuation of deferred tax as a result of the differences above \\n \\nAccording to Solvency II principles, technical provisions are \\nderived as the sum of a best estimate and a risk margin.

This is different from accounting principles where the \\nguaranteed interest rate is used. Also, for index - and unit- linked \\ninsurance, the main difference between accounting and Solvency II principles is the inclusion of future profits in Solvency II.\\n \\nA risk margin is added to the technical provisions according to \\nSolvency II principles. The risk margin is calculated as the cos t of holding the capital needed to cover the solvency capital \\nrequirement through the entire run -off, if all business was \\nterminated. \\nNote that the Solvency II interest rate curves with volatility \\nadjustment are used for determining the Solvency II technic al \\nprovisions, and that no transitional measures are used for the \\ncalculations.  \\nEligible own funds are divided into three capital groups \\naccording to Solvency II regulations. GPF has mainly tier 1 \\ncapital, which is considered to be capital of best quality .  \\nThe tier 2 capital for GPF consists of a subordinated debt, with a nominal amount of NOK 300.0 million. The market value of the \\ndebt is NOK 301.8 million per 31.12.2020.  \\nGPF has no tier 3 capital.  \\nTable 12 - Eligible own funds to meet the Solvency Capi tal \\nRequirement, split by tiers  \\n \\nNOK millions  2020  2019  \\n   \\nTier 1  1,778.9  2,374.3  \\nTier 2  301.8  304.3  \\nOf this; Subordinated liabilities from \\ninsurance  301.8  304.3  \\nTotal eligible own funds to meet SCR  2,080.7  2,678.6  \\n \\nThere are restrictions on the tier 2 capital that can be used to cover the MCR.

Pension  \\nGjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS (GPF)  is required  to have  an \\noccupational  pension plan pursuant  to the Norwegian Act relating  to \\nMandatory  Occupational  Pensions. The Company’s  pension plans  \\nmeet the requirements  of the Act.  \\nGPF has both defined contribution and defined benefit plans  for its \\nemployees. The defined benefit plan has been placed in a separate \\npension fund and is closed to new employees. New  employees  be \\nDefined contribution plan \\nDefined contribution pension is a private  pension plan that \\nsupplements  the National  Insuranc e scheme. Benefits  from the \\npension  plan come in addition  to retirement  pension from the \\nNational  Insurance scheme. The retirement  age is 70.  \\nThe defined contribution  plan is a post-employment benefit plan \\nunder  which GPF pays fixed contributions  into a separate entity  and there is no legal or constructive  obligation  to pay further  amounts.  \\nThe rates  are seven per cent of earnings  between  0 and 7.1 times  \\nthe National  Insurance  basic  amount (G) and 20 per cent of \\nearnings  between 7.1 and 12 G. \\nDisability  pension, spouse/cohabitant pension and child’s  pension \\nare also included in the plan subject to more  detailed  rules.   \\nDefined benefit  plan \\nDescription  of the plan \\nTogether  with benefits  from the National  Insurance scheme and any \\npaid-up policies  from former  employment  relationships, the \\nretirement  pension amounts  to approximately  70 per cent of the \\nfinal salary, given  a full earning  period  of 30 years.  The retirement \\nage is 70, but it is 65 for underwriters.   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n28 The defined benefit plan is a post-employment benef it plan that \\nentitles  employees  to contractual  future  pension benefits. Disability  \\npension, spouse/cohabitant pension and child’s  pension are also \\nincluded  in the plan subject to more detailed  rules.  \\nIn addition,  GPF has pension liabilities  to some employees  over \\nand above the ordinary  group pension agreement. This applies  to \\nemployees  with a lower  retirement age, employees  who earn more  \\nthan 12 times  the National  Insurance  basic  amount (G) and \\nsupplementary  pensions.  \\nThe ordinary  retirement  pension is a funded  plan where the \\nemployer  contributes  by paying  into the pension assets.  Pension  \\nover and above the ordinary  group  pension agreement  is an \\nunfunded plan that is paid for through  operations. \\nActuarial assumptions  \\nActuarial  assumptions  are shown in the table. The discount rate is \\nthe assumption that has the greatest  impact on the value  of the \\npension  liability.  Wage growth, pension  increases  and the \\nadjustment of the National  Insurance  basic  amount are based on \\nhistorical  observations  and expected  future inflation. Wage growth  \\nis set at 2.7 per cent (3.1),  and is adjusted  for age based  on a \\ndecreasing trend.  The year-on-year nominal  wage growth  2020/21  \\nis calculated to be 0.83 per cent (1.55).  The reason  for the low \\nwage growth  is that the pension  plan is closed  to new members  and \\nthat the average age of employee members  is 57.8 years  (56.5).  \\nThe discount  rate is based  on a yield curve  stipulated on the basis  \\nof the covered  bond  yield. The discount rate is based  on observed  \\ninterest approximately  ten years  ahead. The market’s  long-term \\nview of the interest rate level is estimated  on the basis  of the \\nrequired  real interest rate, inflation  and future credit  risk. An \\ninterpolation has been made  in the period between the observed  \\ninterest and long-term market expectations. A discount curve  has \\nthus been  calculated  for each year in which  pensions  will be \\ndisbursed.   \\nThe sensitivity  analysis  is based on only one assumption  being  \\nchanged at a time, while all the others  remain  constant. This is \\nseldom  the case,  since  several  of the assumptions  co-vary.   \\nRisk \\nThe risk in the net pension liability  is a combination of the pension \\nplan itself,  the pension  liability,  pension assets,  financing level and \\nthe co-variation between pension liabilities  and pension assets.   \\nGPF is exposed  to financial  risk since  the pension assets  are \\nmanaged  in Gjensidige  Pensjonskasse  as an investment choice \\nportfolio. The financial  risk is related to investments  in equities,  \\ninterest -bearing  securities  and property. Most of the investments  \\nare in securities  funds  and bonds. The financial  risk comprises  \\nstock  market,  interest rate, credit,  currency  and liquidity  risk, \\nwhereas  the greatest risk factor  is interest rate risk. Financial  risk in \\npension  assets  is estimated  using  defined stress parameters  for \\neach  asset  class and assumptions  about  how the development  of \\nthe different  asset classes  will co-vary.   \\nThe pension  assets  are higher  than the calculated  pension \\nliabilities.  However, it must be tested whether the use of pension \\nassets has a limitation. It is expected that part of the overfunding \\nwill be used to finance new earnings or be returned to the sponsor. \\nA reduction in the liabilities (for example due to a rise in interest \\nrates) will be partially offset by an increase in potential overfunding. The risk factors below must therefore be seen in the light of the \\noverfunding.  \\nInterest  rate risk \\nThe pension  assets’  exposure  to interest rate risk is deemed  to be \\nmoderate  because the market  value- weighted duration is \\napproximately  4.7 years  (3.6).  The portfolio value  will fall by \\napproximately  4.7 per cent in the event of a parallel  shift in the yield \\ncurve  of plus one percentage  point.   \\nThe pension  liability  will increase  by 17.9 per cent in the event of a \\nparallel  shift in the whole yield curve  (fall in interest)  of minus  one percentage  point.  The value will fall by 13.4 per cent in the event  of \\nan interest  rate increase  of one percentag e point.  \\nCredit risk \\nThe pension  assets’  exposure  to credit  risk is deemed to be \\nmoderate.   Most  of the pension  fund’s  fixed- income  investments  \\nshall be within  “investment grade”. If the credit  risk on a global  basis  \\nwere  to increase by a factor  corresponding  to the factor  used  in \\nstress  tests for pension  funds  (equal  to a deterioration in relation to \\nthe 99.5 percentile), this would  lead to a fall of approximately  nine \\nper cent in the bond portfolio.  \\nThe pension  liabilities  are exposed to some credit  risk because the \\nNorwegian  covered bond  yield, which forms  the basis  for \\ndetermining  the discount rate, entails  a certain credit  risk.  \\nEquity and real estate risk  \\nThe pension assets are exposed to the stock market and the real \\nestate market through equity funds and real estate funds. At the \\nend of the year, the exposure was 19.6 per cent, divided into 11.9 per cent shares and 7.7 per cent in real estate.  \\nThe market value of shares fluctuates sharply. Gjensidige Pensjonskasse continuously measures the  equity risk in the \\npension assets based on the principles in Solvency II. The principles for measuring equity risk are based on the fact that the \\nrisk increases when shares rise in value and that the risk declines \\nwhen shares have fallen in value. As at 3 1 December 2020, the risk \\n(equal to a deterioration in relation to the 99.5 percentile) is set at \\n39 per cent. Property risk is set at 25 per cent based on the \\nprinciples in Solvency II.  \\nLife expectancy  and disability  \\nThe life expectancy  assumptions  are based on the K2013BE  table \\nas reported  by FNO (Finans  Norge)  AS.  \\nThe rate of disability  is based  on the IR73 table.  This measures  \\nlong-term disability.  The incidence  of disability  is low compared to \\nmany  other  employers.  \\nGPF’s  employees  could be involved in big disaster -like events  such \\nas plane crashes,  bus crashes,  as spectators  at sporting events  or \\nthrough  incidents  in the workplace. If such an event occurs,  the \\npension  liability  could  significantly  increase. GPF has invested in \\ndisaster  insurance that means  that it will receive compensation  if \\nsuch an event  occurs.  \\nWage growth  \\nFuture  pension benefits  depend  on future wage  growth  and the \\ndevelopment of the National  Insurance  basic  amount (G). If wage \\ngrowth  in the Company  is lower  than the increase in G, the benefits  \\nwill be reduced.  \\nWage growth  will deviate  from the path defined by employees  \\ngetting higher  or lower  wage growth than what the job indicates.  \\nGPF manages  employees’  wage growth  based  on collective \\nagreements  and individual  agreements. Salar y levels  can increase  \\nstrongly  from one year to the next.  \\nIf wage  growth  is one percentage point  higher, it will lead to a 9.9 \\nper cent increase  in the liability.  If wage growth  is one percentage \\npoint lower, it will lead to a 7.9 per cent decrease in the liability.  If G \\nis one percentage  point  higher  it will lead to a 4.3 per cent decrease \\nin the liability.   \\nMinimum  requirement for the level of pension assets \\nThe pension  assets  must  meet certain  minimum  requirements  \\ndefined in Norwegian  laws,  regulations  and in orders  issued  by the \\nFinancial  Supervisory  Authority  of Norway  (FSA).  \\nIf the level of the pension  assets  falls below  a lower  limit, GPF will \\nhave  to pay extra  pension contributions  to bring  them  up to the \\nlower  limit. On certain  conditions,  GPF will also be repaid pension \\nassets.   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n29 Gjensidige Pensjonskasse measures risk based on requirements \\nset by the Financial Supervisory Authority in the form of stress tests. These tests should reflect 99.5 per cent value at risk. The \\npension fund has a solvency capital margin of 138 per cent without \\nthe use of transitional rules, which indicates that there is no requirement to provide pension funds to improve the pension fund’s \\nsolvency.    \\nPrivate collective pension (AFP)  \\nAs a member  of Finance Norway,  GPF has a collective (AFP) \\npension  agreement for its employees. AFP is a defined benefit \\nscheme funded jointly  by many  employers. The administrator  of the \\npension  plan has not presented calculations  that allocate  the pension  assets  or liabilities  in the plans  to the individual  member  \\nenterprises. GPF therefore recognises  the plan as a defined \\ncontribution  plan.   \\nIf the administrator  of the AFP plan presents  such allocation figures,  \\nthis could result in the plan being  recognise d as a defined  benefit  \\nplan. It is difficult, however, to arrive  at an allocation key that is \\nacceptable  to the members.  An allocation key based  on the GPF’s  \\nshare  of total annual  pay will not be acceptable since  such a key is \\ntoo simple  and will not adequ ately reflect the financial  liabilities.   \\n \\n \\nNOK millions  Funded 2020  Unfunded 2020  Total 2020  Funded 2019  Unfunded 2019  Total 2019  \\n       \\nPresent value of the defined benefit obligation        \\nAs at 1 January  15.6 2.5 18.1 13.5 2.5 16.0 \\nCurrent service cost  0.7 0.1 0.8 0.6 0.2 0.8 \\nEmployers\\' national insurance contributions of \\ncurrent service cost  0.1  0.2 0.1  0.2 \\nInterest cost  0.3 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.5 \\nActuarial gains and losses  2.1 1.3 3.4 1.5 (0.2) 1.3 \\nBenefits paid  (0.2)  (0.2) (0.2)  (0.2) \\nEmployers\\' national insurance contributions of \\nbenefits paid  (0.3)  (0.3) (0.4)  (0.4) \\nBusiness combinations  3.4  3.4   - \\nAs at 31 December  21.8 4.0 25.7 15.6 2.5 18.1 \\n       \\nFair value of plan assets        \\nAs at 1 January  18.0  18.0 14.9  14.9 \\nInterest income  0.4  0.4 0.5  0.5 \\nReturn beyond interest income  0.8  0.8 0.5  0.5 \\nContributions by the employer  2.0  2.0 2.7  2.7 \\nContributions by plan participants  (0.2)  (0.2)    \\nBenefits paid  2.7  2.7 (0.2)  (0.2) \\nEmployers\\' national insurance contributions of \\nbenefits paid  (0.3)  (0.3) (0.4)  (0.4) \\nAs at 31 December  23.5  23.5 18.0  18.0 \\n       \\nAmount recognised in the balance sheet        \\nPresent value of the defined benefit obligation  21.8 4.0 25.7 15.6 2.5 18.1 \\nFair value of plan assets  23.5  23.5 18.0  18.0 \\nNet defined benefit obligation/(benefit asset)  (1.7) 4.0 2.3 (2.4) 2.5 0.1 \\n       \\nPension expense recognised in profit or loss        \\nCurrent service cost  0.7 0.1 0.8 0.6 0.2 0.8 \\nInterest cost  0.3 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.5 \\nInterest income  (0.4)  (0.4) (0.5)  (0.5) \\nEmployers\\' national insurance contributions  0.1  0.2 0.1  0.2 \\nTotal defined benefit pension cost  0.7 0.2 1.0 0.7 0.3 1.0 \\n       \\nThe expense is recognised in the following line \\nin the income statement        \\nInsurance- related administration expenses    1.0   1.0 \\n       \\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit \\nliability/asset recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income        \\nCumulative amount as at 1 January    (1.3)   (0.5) \\nRecognized in the period    (2.5)   (0.8) \\nCumulative amount as at 31 December    (3.8)   (1.3) \\n       \\nActuarial assumptions        \\nDiscount rate    1.67%    2.21%  \\nFuture salary increases 1   2.65%    3.14%  \\nChange in social security base amount    2.77%    3.14%  \\n       \\n   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n30 NOK millions  Funded 2020  Unfunded 2020  Total 2020  Funded 2019  Unfunded 2019  Total 2019  \\n       \\nOther specifications        \\nAmount recognised as expense for the defined \\ncontribution plan eksl VAT    5.4   4.7 \\nAmount recognised as expense for \\nFellesordningen LO/NHO eksl VAT    0.9   0.9 \\nExpected contribution to Fellesordningen LO/NHO \\nnext year    1.1   1.0 \\nExpected contribution to the defined benefit plan \\nfor the next year    1.7   2.3 \\n       \\n1 Future salary increases represent our expected average future salary increase for the industry.

Financial assets and liabilities  \\nFair value \\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are carried \\nat the amount each asset/liability can be settled to in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the measurements \\ndate at the prevailing market conditions.  \\nDifferent valuation techniques and methods are used to estimate \\nfair value depending on the type of financial instruments and to \\nwhich extent they are traded in active markets. Instruments are \\nclassified in their entirety in one of three valuation levels i n a \\nhierarchy on the basis of the lowest level of input that is \\nsignificant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  \\nThe different valuation levels and which financial assets/liabilities that are included in the respective levels are accounted for \\nbelow.  \\nQuoted prices in active markets \\nQuoted prices in active markets are considered the best estimate of an asset/liability’s fair value. A financial asset/liability \\nis considered valued based on quoted prices in active markets if \\nfair value is estimated based on easily and regularly available prices and these prices represent actual and regularly occurring \\ntransactions at arm’s length principle. Financial assets/liabilities \\nvalued based on quoted prices in active markets are classified \\nas level one in the valuation hierarchy.  \\nThe following financial assets are classified as level one in the \\nvaluation hierarchy  \\n• Listed shares  \\n• Norwegian government/government backed bonds and \\nother fixed income securities  \\n• Exchange traded funds  \\n Valuation based on observable mar ket data \\nWhen quoted prices in active markets are not available, the fair \\nvalue of financial assets/ liabilities is preferably estimated on the \\nbasis of valuation techniques based on observable market data.  \\nA financial asset/liability is considered valued based on observable market data if fair value is estimated with reference to prices that are not quoted, but are observable either directly \\n(as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).  \\nThe following financial assets/liabilities are classified as level two \\nin the valuation hierarchy  \\n• Currency futures, equity options, forward rate agreements \\nand currency swaps, in which fair value is derived from \\nthe value of underlying instruments. These derivatives \\nare valued using common valuation techniques for \\nderivatives (option pricing models etc.). \\n• Equity funds, bond funds, hedge funds and combination \\nfunds, in which fair value is estimated based on the fair \\nvalue of the underlying investments of the funds.  \\n• Bonds, certificates or index bonds that are unlisted, or \\nthat are listed but where transactions are not occurring \\nregularly. The unlisted instruments in this category are \\nvalued based on observable yield curves and estimated \\ncredit spreads where applicable. \\n• Interest- bearing liabilities (banking activities) measured at \\nfair value. These liabilities are valued based on \\nobservable credit spreads. \\n• Listed subordinated notes where transactions are not \\noccurring regularly.  \\n \\nValuation based on non -observable market data \\nWhen neither quoted prices in active markets nor observable \\nmarket data is available, the fair value of financial \\nassets/liabilities is estimated based on valuation techniques \\nwhich are based on non -observable market data.  \\nA financial asset/liability is considered valued based on non -\\nobservable market da ta if fair value is estimated without being \\nbased on quoted prices in active markets or observable market data. Financial assets/liabilities valued based on non- observable \\nmarket data are classified as level three in the valuation hierarchy.  \\nThe only financial assets classified as level three in the valuation \\nhierarchy are shares in Norsk Pensjon AS and \\nPensjonsregisteret AS.  \\n \\n   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n32 NOK millions  Carrying \\namount as at \\n31.12.2020  Fair value as \\nat 31.12.2020  Carrying \\namount as at \\n31.12.2019  Fair value as \\nat 31.12.2019  \\n     \\nFinancial assets      \\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss, designated upon initial recognition      \\nShares and similar interests  3.7 3.7 6.3 6.3 \\nBonds and other fixed income securities  1,578.2  1,578.2  1,575.5  1,575.5  \\nShares and similar interests in life insurance with investment options  28,330.6  28,330.6  24,502.5  24,502.5  \\nBonds and other fixed income securities in life insurance with investment options  4,594.3  4,594.3  4,196.5  4,196.5  \\n     \\nLoans and receivables      \\nBonds and other fixed income securities classified as loans and receivables  5,718.7  6,090.8  5,246.3  5,372.8  \\nReceivables related to direct operations and reinsurance  78.4 78.4 81.2 81.2 \\nOther receivables  184.4  184.4  232.3  232.3  \\nCash and cash equivalents  205.9  205.9  210.4  210.4  \\n     \\nTotal financial assets  40,694.3  41,066.3  36,050.9  36,177.5  \\n     \\nFinancial liabilities      \\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost      \\nSubordinated debt  299.9  301.8  299.8  304.3  \\nOther liabilities  39.8 39.8 76.9 76.9 \\nLiabilities related to direct insurance  116.3  116.3  85.6 85.6 \\n     \\nTotal financial liabilities  456.0  457.9  462.3  466.8  \\n     \\nGain/(loss) not recognised in profit or loss   370.2   122.0  \\n \\nValuation hierarchy 2020      \\n     \\nThe table shows a valuation hierarchy where financial assets/liabilities are divided into three levels based on the method of valuation.  \\n     \\n Level 1  Level 2  Level 3   \\nNOK millions  Quoted prices \\nin active \\nmarkets  Valuation  \\ntechniques \\nbased on \\nobservable \\nmarket data  Valuation  \\ntechniques \\nbased on non-\\nobservable \\nmarket data  Total  \\n     \\nFinancial assets      \\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss, designated upon initial recognition      \\nShares and similar interests   2.8 0.9 3.7 \\nBonds and other fixed income securities   1,578.2   1,578.2  \\nShares and similar interests in life insurance with investment options   28,330.6   28,330.6  \\nBonds and other fixed income securities in life insurance with investment options   4,594.3   4,594.3  \\n     \\nFinancial assets at amortised cost      \\nBonds and other fixed income securities classified as loans and receivables   6,090.8   6,090.8  \\n     \\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost      \\nSubordinated debt   301.8   301.8  \\n     \\n     \\n   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n33 Valuation hierarchy 2019      \\n     \\nThe table shows a valuation hierarchy where financial assets/liabilities are divided into three levels based on the method of valuation.  \\n     \\n Level 1  Level 2  Level 3   \\nNOK millions  Quoted prices \\nin active \\nmarkets  Valuation  \\ntechniques \\nbased on \\nobservable \\nmarket data  Valuation  \\ntechniques \\nbased on non -\\nobservable \\nmarket data  Total  \\n     \\nFinancial assets      \\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss, designated upon initial recognition      \\nShares and similar interests   6.1 0.2 6.3 \\nBonds and other fixed income securities   1,575.5   1,575.5  \\nShares and similar interests in life insurance with investment options   24,502.5   24,502.5  \\nBonds and other fixed income securities in life insurance with investment options   4,196.5   4,196.5  \\n     \\nFinancial assets at amortised cost      \\nBonds and other fixed income securities classified as loans and receivables   5,372.8   5,372.8  \\n     \\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost      \\nSubordinated debt   304.3   304.3  \\n     \\n \\nReconciliation of financial assets valued based on non -observable market data (level 3) 2019  \\n         \\nNOK millions  As at \\n1.1.2020  Net \\nrealised/  \\nunrealised \\ngains  \\nrecognised \\nin profit or \\nloss Purch -

Share -based payment  \\nDescription of the share-based payment \\narrangements \\nAs at 31 December 2020 Gjensidige Pensjonsforsikring AS has \\nthe following share -based payment arrangements:  \\n \\nShare -based remuneration for executive personnel with \\nsettlement in equity and cash (remuneration scheme)  \\nGjensidige has established equity -settled share- based payment \\nfor the group management and more explicitly defined executive \\npersonnel.  \\nAs described in the Board’s statement on the stipulation of pay \\nand other remuneration in note 14, half of the variable \\nremuneration is paid in the form of shares in Gjensidige \\nForsikring ASA, one third of which will be available in each of the \\nfollowing three years. The part that is to cover the tax liability is \\nwithheld and settled in the form of cas h (net settlement) and the \\nremaining is distributed in the form of shares.  \\nThe fair value  at the grant  date is measured based  on the \\nmarket  price.  The amount is recognised  as payroll  expenses  at \\ngrant date with a corresponding  increase  in other  paid-in equity, \\nboth for the part that is settled  in equity  and for the part that is \\nsettled  in cash to cover  the tax obligations. No specific  company -\\nrelated or market -related entitlement criteria  apply  to the shares, \\nbut the Company  may carry  out a reassessment  if subsequent \\nresults  and development suggest  that the bonus  was based  on \\nincorrect  assumptions. The expected allocation is set to 100 per \\ncent. No adjustment  is made to the value  of the cash- settled  \\nshare  based  on the share price  at the reporting  date. The \\nnumber  of shares  is adjusted  for dividend paid.  \\nEquity -settled share savings program for employees Gjensidige  has established a share  savings  programme for \\nemployees  of the Group with the exception  of employees  of \\nGjensidige  Baltic.  All employees  are given  an opportunity  to \\nsave an annual  amount  of up to NOK  90,000. Saving take the \\nform of fixed deductions  from salary  that is used  to buy shares  \\nfour times  a year. The employees  are offered  a discount in the \\nform of a contribution  of 25 per cent, limited  upwa rds to NOK  \\n7,500  kroner  per year,  which corresponds  to the maximum  tax-\\nexempt  discount.  Employees  will receive  one bonus  share  for \\nevery  four shares  they have owned  for more  than two years,  \\nprovided that they are still employed by the Company  or have \\nbecom e retired.  No other  vesting  conditions  exists  in this \\narrangement.  \\nThe fair value  at grant date is based on the market  price. The \\ndiscount  is recognised  as payroll  expenses  at the time of \\nallocation with a corresponding  increase  in other  paid- in equity.  \\nThe value of the bonus  shares  is recognised as payroll  \\nexpenses  over the vesting period,  which is two years, with a \\ncorresponding  increase  in other  paid-in equity.  \\nFair value measurement  \\nThe fair value  of the shares  allocated through  the share- based  \\npayment for executive  personnel  and the cash to cover  the tax \\nobligations  is calculated  on the basis  of the share  price  at grant \\ndate.  The amount  is recognised  immediately.  \\nFair value of the bonus  shares  allocated through  the share \\nsavings  program  is calculated on the basis  of the share price  at \\ngrant date, taking  into account  the likelihood  of the employee  still \\nbeing employed after two years  and that he/she has not sold \\nhis/her  shares  during  the same  two-year period.  The amount  is \\nrecognised during  the vesting  period which is two years.   \\n Gjensidige  Pensjonsforsikring  AS \\n \\n42 The following assum ptions were used in the calculation of fair value at the time of calculation  \\n     \\n Remuneration scheme  Share savings programme  \\n 2020  2019  2020  2019  \\n     \\nWeighted average share price (NOK)  189.00  143.00  192.65  163.02  \\nExpected turnover  I/A I/A 10% 10% \\nExpected sale  I/A I/A 5% 5% \\nLock-in period (years)  3 3 2 2 \\nExpected dividend (NOK per share) 1 6.45 10.92  6.45 10.92  \\n     \\n1 The expected return is based on the Group\\'s actual profit/loss after tax expense as of the third quarter, grossed up to a ful l year, plus the maximum distribution of dividend corresponding \\nto 00 per cent of the profit after tax expense.
